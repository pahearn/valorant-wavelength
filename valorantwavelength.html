    <p>The computer has picked a random number X between 1 and 10.
        <div>Using this number X, the computer has selected four hints that are an X/10 in the category.</div>
        <div>Your goal is to guess what the number is using the hints provided.</div>
        <div>You will be given a Map, Weapon, Ultimate Ability, and an Agent.</div>
        <div>For each number, there are more than one possible hints in each category.</div>
        <div>For example, a 9 could give you a Phantom, Vandal, Odin, or Operator as the weapon.</div>
        <div>Each hint can also correspond to more than one number.</div>
        <div>For example, the Vandal can be an 8, 9 or 10.</div>
        <div>This was done to increase replayability and simulate the variety in answers that you would get from playing with another person</div>
